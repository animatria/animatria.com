<p>Hadoop's batch processing style of execution has been a limiting factor in it's application to real time analytics. Spark, a new age cluster computing framework, developed in 2009, in the AMP Lab at University of Berkeley,has in recent times emerged as a potential solution to this problem.</p>
<p>Spark, with it's in-memory caching ability not only offers significant boost in performance but also allows for near real time data processing. As compared to Hadoop,which relies solely on disk based storage, Spark's performance is reportedly 100 times faster in memory, and 10 times faster on disk.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, Spark offers flexibility with regards to choosing appropriate data storage systems, since it can operate not only on HDFS, but also can leverage the likes of Cassandra or Amazon's S3.</p>
<p>Being an integrated framework,Spark offers a single execution engine for multiple processing options such as SQL queries, streaming analytics, graph analytics and machine learning. Hadoop, on the other hand relies on multiple solutions such as Hive, Storm,GraphLab and Mahout for each of the above capabilities, thereby, increasing complexity of execution and integration.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, Hadoop, when introduced, was a ground breaking technology that has served us all well till date. However, limitations in Hadoop ranging from complexities in execution, processing inefficiencies and restricted real time analytics processing are certainly paving path for newer technologies like Spark.</p>
